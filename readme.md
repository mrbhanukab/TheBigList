## Setup & Installation

### For Windows, Linux, MacOS

![Windows](https://img.shields.io/badge/Windows-0078D6?style=for-the-badge&logo=windows&logoColor=white) ![Linux](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux-FCC624?style=for-the-badge&logo=linux&logoColor=black) ![Mac](https://img.shields.io/badge/mac%20os-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=apple&logoColor=white)

It is recommended to use browser extensions like [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com) or browsers like [Brave](https://brave.com) or [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com). Alternatively, you can manually edit your hosts file or use software to do so, but you may need to perform additional steps since these block lists are generated for browser-based ad blockers.

### For Rooted/Unrooted Android, iOS

Using browsers like [Brave](https://brave.com) or [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com) is the easiest way. Alternatively, you can use [Nebulo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.frostnerd.smokescreen&hl=en&pli=1) or [personalDNSfilter](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dnsfilter.android&hl=en) for Android, and [Blokada](https://blokada.org) for Android and iOS.

### Steps

The steps vary based on the browser/extension you use. These are general steps. If you are new to the extension/browser you are using, I highly recommend searching the internet for `how to add a custom block list on {your extension/browser}` or contacting a tech-savvy friend.

1. Go to your AdBlocker extension/browser settings.
2. Navigate to 'add custom block list.'
3. Copy the following URLs as needed and paste them into the appropriate fields.
